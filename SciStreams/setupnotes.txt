:Extra notes for setup (eventually should go in some documentation):
- config file. Should place it in ~/config/scistreams/scistreams.yml
- mask : need to set the maskdir parameter to where masks are stored
	- masks should be stored in
		maskdir/detector_key/some masks etc.png etc...
		so:
		maskdir/pilatus300_image/
		maskdir/pilatus2M_image/
		etc
